- Step 73: declare song & assign value using OR operator with userData?.currentSong or userData?.songs[0]
- Step 74: use playButton.setAttribute to set aria-label with two different values Play ${song.title} or "Play" by checking song?.title is available or not
- Step 75: modify playSong() by adding setPlayButtonAccessibleText()
- Step 76: declare shuffle as arrow function to prepare for shuffle songs
- Step 77: use userData?.songs.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5) to get random songlist
- Step 78: set the currentSong to nothing and the songCurrentTime to 0
- Step 79: re-render the songs, pause the currently playing song, set the player display, and set the play button accessible text again
- Step 80: add addEventListener("click", shuffle) for shuffleButton to make shuffle button functional
- Step 81: declare deleteSong as arrow function to prepare for delete function in playlist
- Step 82: assign userData.songs using filter() method of userData?.songs & id song as parameter of the arrow function callback &　use implicit return to check if song.id is strictly not equal to id
- Step 83: call renderSongs()  pass in the userData?.songs array as an argument & call highlightCurrentSong() to highlight the current song if there is any & call setPlayButtonAccessibleText() 
- Step 84: add if statement to check if deleting song is current playing song
- Step 85: if true in Step 84 set userData.currentSong to null & userData.songCurrentTime to 0 then call pauseSong() & setPlayerDisplay() to pause song & update display of player
- Step 86: Within the button element in the renderSongs() add onclick attribute & use deleteSong(song.id) as value
- Step 87: add if statement to check if playlist is empty
- Step 88: declare resetButton & use createElement() to create a "button"
- Step 89: use createTextNode() method to create "Reset Playlist" as text & assign it to resetText constant
- Step 90: assign resetButton with id="reset" & aria-label attributes to "Reset playlist"
- Step 91: Use appendChild() to attach resetText to resetButton element, and resetButton to the playlistSongs element
- Step 92: add addEventListener("click", ) for resetButton & pass a callback using arrow syntax to prepare for  reset the playlist to its original state
- Step 93: spread allSongs into an array and assign it to userData.songs using [...'arrayname'] (展開運算子)
- Step 94: call renderSongs() using sortSongs() as argument & call setPlayButtonAccessibleText() to update play button's accessible text & call remove() method of resetButton
- Step 95: add addEventListener("ended", ) for audio & pass a callback using arrow syntax to prepare for auto play song when current song ends
- Step 96: in Step 95 call back　declare currentSongIndex with getCurrentSongIndex() assigned & declare nextSongExists with assigned true || false using ternary operator by comparing (userData.songs.length-1) > currentSongIndex
- Step 97 : add if statement to check if nextSongExists exists then call playNextSong() function
- Step 98 : add else statement to set userData.currentSong to null & userData.songCurrentTime to 0
- Step 99: call pauseSong() , setPlayerDisplay(), highlightCurrentSong() & setPlayButtonAccessibleText() to set player correctly
